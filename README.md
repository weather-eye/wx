## About

## Development

### First things first

You can develop on Windows, GNU/Linux or Mac OS X. You need:

- [Python 3.6 and above](https://www.python.org/) and a python [**virtual environment**](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Other considerations:

- If you're running Windows, I highly recommend using [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) as your console emulator. It comes bundled with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and will be less frustrating than using the default Windows console.
- I also recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your editor. Of course you're free to use whatever editor you want!

### Getting Started
First, [fork](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html) this repository to your namespace, then fire up your command prompt and ...

1. Clone the forked repository
2. Navigate to the cloned project directory: `cd project_name`
3. activate your python virtual environment and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. `pre-commit install`
5. `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`
6. `pre-commit run --all-files`

Now you can start working on the code.

### Tests

Simply run `pytest`. For more detailed output, including test coverage:

```sh
pytest -vv --cov=. --cov-report term-missing
```

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the project:

- if you're making code contributions, please try and write some tests to accompany your code, and ensure that the tests pass.
- commit your changes via `cz commit`. Follow the prompts. When you're done, `pre-commit` will be invoked to ensure that your contributions and commits follow defined conventions. See `pre-commit-config.yaml` for more details.
- your commit messages should follow the conventions described [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like `git merge` and `git revert`.
Once you are done, please send a [merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/).

## TODO
